## The Wizards are coming...

Finally, the town I'm from has a sports team that's worth rooting for, they're exciting and bonus: their team name isn't a racial slur! It's the Wizards!

They're currently number 2 in the East, and only 1.5 games behind Toronto. Thankfully, Canada is not used to excelling so I'm optimistic that the Wizards will can get to the top. Then hopefully we can convice Kevin Durant to come back home. 

Seriously, how can you not love these guys?
